<h1>Anti-Money Laundering Policy</h1>

<p>Satofin takes money laundering risks very seriously. We have implemented an anti-money laundering (AML) program to follow all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<h2>Monitoring Transactions</h2>

<p>Satofin's AML program includes ongoing monitoring of all transactions. Our system flags suspicious activity based on transaction size, frequency, origin, and other red flags. Any suspicious activity is escalated for further investigation.</p>

<h2>Know Your Customer</h2> 

<p>We collect identifying information on all customers per KYC/AML regulations. Customer identity is verified before accounts are activated. Enhanced due diligence is conducted for high risk customers.</p>

<h2>Record Keeping</h2>

<p>Detailed records of all transactions and customer activity are retained for a minimum of 5 years, as required by law. Records include customer identity, transaction amount, date, time, origin, etc.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>Satofin files Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and other required regulatory reports whenever money laundering or illicit financing is suspected.</p>

<h2>Cooperating with Law Enforcement</h2>

<p>We cooperate fully with law enforcement investigations and regulatory audits involving AML or any financial crime.</p>

<p>Please contact us if you have any questions about our comprehensive AML policies and procedures.</p>
